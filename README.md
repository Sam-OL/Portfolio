Hello and welcome, My name is Samuel Öhman-Lebender and this is my portfolio site.
It is currently "under construction" so to say, I´m building it using a React-Typescript FE and a ASPNET core webapi to gather the data from.
Since it is under construction, I´m spending a lot of my time using it as not only a portfolio but also a learning experience where I try new things, and explore my personal style, especially in the FE.
